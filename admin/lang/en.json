    "about": "After graduating as a Computer Installation and Maintenance Technician in 2021, I completed various professional internships and worked under fixed-term contracts in various companies operating in the fields of mobile & web programming and e-commerce. I sold my first software when I was in high school. For the development of applications and websites, I mainly use laravel and symfony for the creation, redesign and maintenance of websites and web applications without forgetting the essential tools of front-end development such as html, css and javascriptI also master Node.js, AngularJS, VueJS, ReactJs, Django technologies. I know how to design management applications (stocks, human resources, invoicing, ERP, CRM) for companies whatever their size. I can also develop applications that can allow you to interact with maps or plans. I developed a human resources management application and an invoicing application on behalf of BHT SARL, which has around ten shops. I was a web integrator in an e-commerce company called FuturaVision. Currently I am a fullstack developer within the startup HyPerText which specializes in the design of Web & mobile applications.",
